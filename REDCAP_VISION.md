**RedCap: Smart Sales Pricing for Construction & Contractors**

---

## 🔴 The Problem

Sales reps in construction face constant pressure:
- "What's the lowest I can go?" 
- "Am I leaving money on the table?"
- "Did I just lose margin on that deal?"

**Result:** Inconsistent pricing, lost revenue, and damaged margins.

## 🎩 The RedCap Solution

**Cap & Red Line Pricing** gives sales teams clear boundaries:

```
🎩 Cap ($3,000)           ← Maximum price (target)
    │
    ├── 💚 High Margin Zone
    │
💰 Negotiated ($2,200)    ← Actual deal
    │
    ├── ⚠️ Medium Margin Zone
    │
🔴 Red Line ($1,500)      ← Never go below
    │
    └── 🚫 No Deal Zone
```

### For Sales Reps:
